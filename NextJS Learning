Adding Component-Level CSS
Next.js supports CSS Modules using the [name].module.css file naming convention.
CSS Modules locally scope CSS by automatically creating a unique class name. This allows you to use the same CSS class name in different files without
worrying about collisions.

This behavior makes CSS Modules the ideal way to include component-level CSS. CSS Module files can be imported anywhere in your application.
CSS Modules are an optional feature and are only enabled for files with the .module.css extension.
In production, all CSS Module files will be automatically concatenated into many minified and code-split .css files. These .css files represent hot
execution paths in your application, ensuring the minimal amount of CSS is loaded for your application to paint.
